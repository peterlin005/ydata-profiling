# Dataset Comparison

!!! note "Dataframes compare support"

    Profiling compare is supported from
    ydata-profiling version 3.5.0 onwards.
    Profiling compare is not *(yet!)* available for Spark Dataframes

`ydata-profiling` can be used to compare multiple version of the same
dataset. This is useful when comparing data from multiple time periods,
such as two years. Another common scenario is to view the dataset
profile for training, validation and test sets in machine learning.

The following syntax can be used to compare two datasets:

``` python linenums="1" title="Comparing 2 datasets"
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

train_df = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
train_report = ProfileReport(train_df, title="Train")

test_df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
test_report = ProfileReport(test_df, title="Test")

comparison_report = train_report.compare(test_report)
comparison_report.to_file("comparison.html")
```

The comparison report uses the `title` attribute out of `Settings` as a
label throughout. The colors are configured in
`settings.html.style.primary_colors`. The numeric precision parameter
`settings.report.precision` can be played with to obtain some additional
space in reports.

In order to compare more than two reports, the following syntax can be
used:

``` python linenums="1" title="Comparing more than 2 datasets"
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport, compare

comparison_report = compare([train_report, validation_report, test_report])

# Obtain merged statistics
statistics = comparison_report.get_description()

# Save report to file
comparison_report.to_file("comparison.html")
```

!!! note

    This functionality only ensures the support report comparison
    of two datasets. It is possible to obtain the statistics - the report
    may have formatting issues. One of the settings that can be changed is
    `settings.report.precision`. As a rule of thumb, the value 10 can be
    used for a single report and 8 for comparing two reports.
