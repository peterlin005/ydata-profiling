    This feature is only available for users of [YData Fabric](https://ydata.ai).

    [Sign-up Fabric community](http://ydata.ai/register?utm_source=ydata-profiling&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=YData%20Fabric%20Community) and
    start your journey into **data management** with automated PII identification.

Personal Identifiable Information **(PII)** refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual.
This includes but is not limited to, names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, 
and financial information. PII is crucial in today's digital age, where data is extensively collected, stored, 
and processed.

[YData Fabric Data Catalog](https://ydata.ai/products/data_catalog), a scalable and interactive version of ydata-profiling, 
integrates into the data profiling experience, an advanced machine learning solutions based on a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model
combine with traditional rule-based patterns identification, allowing to efficiently detect PII.

## Why Fabric Catalog automated PII identification?

The relevance of automating the identification of PII lies in the need to protect individuals' privacy and comply
with various data protection regulations. Mishandling or unauthorized access to PII can lead to severe consequences
such as identity theft, financial fraud, and breaches of privacy. With the increasing volume of data generated manual
identification of PII becomes impractical and error-prone.

Additionally, having a robust PII management solution is essential for organizations to establish and maintain 
a secure approach to handling sensitive information, fostering trust and adhering to legal requirements.

## Why Fabric to manage dataset PII identification

Besides automated PII identification, *Fabric Catalog* offers several key benefits in the content of data governance,
privacy compliance and overall data management, through automated data profiling and metadata management:

### Compliance with Privacy Regulations:
Many countries and regions have stringent data protection regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA) 
that require organizations to handle PII responsibly. A dedicated platform ensures that PII is correctly classified, 
helping organizations comply with legal requirements and avoid potential penalties.

### Data Profiling for Accuracy:

Data profiling involves analyzing and understanding the structure and content of data. By incorporating data profiling
capabilities into the platform, organizations can ensure accurate identification and classification of PII.
This helps in maintaining the integrity of data and reduces the risk of misclassifications.

### Efficient Management of PII:
As the volume of data continues to grow, manually managing and editing PII classifications becomes impractical. 
A platform streamlines this process, making it more efficient and reducing the likelihood of errors. 
It allows organizations to keep track of PII across various datasets and systems.

### Facilitating Data Governance:

Data governance involves establishing policies and processes to ensure high data quality, security, and compliance. 
A PII management solution enhances data governance efforts by providing a centralized hub for overseeing PII classifications,
metadata, and related policies.
