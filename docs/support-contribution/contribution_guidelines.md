# Contribution Guidelines

## Contributing a new feature

-   Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
-   Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and
    solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Development tooling

To ease the development cycle, some tools are available. These can be
called from the root directory with the `make` command.

The following commands are supported:

``` console
make lint
make install
make examples
make docs
make test
make clean
```

## Contribution quality standards

To guarantee a high quality of the contributed code, the project
workflow validates the added modification as well as the introduced
commit messages. The same mechanisms are used locally to find and solve
existing issues before submitting a pull request.

To activate the local mechanisms (created using pre-commit hooks), run the
following commands:

``` console
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-commit
```

## Git workflow

The Git workflow used in this project is based on [this blog
post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Using
this workflow allows for better collaboration between contributors and
automation of repetitive tasks.

In addition to the workflow described in the blog post, Github Actions
lints the code automatically on the release branches and builds
documentation from each push to the master branch. For now, we don\'t
use hotfix branches.

**Branch naming:**

- develop: development branch 
- master: master branch 
- feat/\[FEATURE NAME\]: feature branches 
- docs/\[branch name\]: documentation and examples
