# Welcome

Data quality profiling and exploratory data analysis are crucial steps in the process of Data Science and Machine Learning development. 
YData-profiling is a leading tool in the data understanding step of the data science workflow as a pioneering Python package. 

`ydata-profiling` is a leading package for data profiling, that automates and standardizes the generation of detailed reports, 
complete with statistics and visualizations. The significance of the package lies in how it streamlines the process of
understanding and preparing data for analysis in a single line of code! If you're ready to get started see the [quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md)!

!!! tip "Advent of Code - Get featured on ydata-profiling"

    *‚ÄúI want to get into open source, but I don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù* - Does this sound familiar to you? Have you been wanting to
    get more involved with open-source software, but no one‚Äôs given you an entry point?
    
    That's why we joined [The Advent of code this year](https://zilliz.com/advent-of-code). Contribute to ydata-profiling and win some üêºüêº swag!

## Why use ydata-profiling?

`ydata-profiling` is a valuable tool for data scientists and analysts because it streamlines EDA, provides comprehensive insights, enhances data quality,
and promotes data science best practices.

- **Simple to user**: It is so **simple to use** - a single line of code is what you need to get you started. *Do you really need more to convince you?* üòõ
```python linenums="1"
import pandas as pd
from ydata_profiling import ProfileReport

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
profile = ProfileReport(df, title="Profiling Report")
```
- **Comprehensive insights in a report**: a report including a wide range of statistics and visualizations, 
providing a holistic view of your data. The report is shareable as a html file or while integrate as a widget in a Jupyter Notebook. 
- **Data quality assessment**: excel at the identification of missing data, duplicate entries and outliers. These insights are essential
for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the reliability of your analysis and leading to early problems' identification.
-  **Ease of integration with other flows**: all metrics of the data profiling can be consumed in a standard JSON format.
- **Data exploration for large datasets**: even with dataset with a large number of rows, `ydata-profiling` will be able to help you
as it supports both Pandas Dataframes and [Spark Dataframes](integrations/pyspark.md).
